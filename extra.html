<body>ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm SHIVAM KARN, a dedicated engineering student with a passion for innovation and
  problem-solving. Currently pursuing my degree in COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERING at AMRITA VISHWA
  VIDYAPEETHAM, I'm eager to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges. Whether it's
  designing circuits, writing code, or tinkering with machinery, I thrive on the excitement of
  discovery and learning. Outside of academics, I enjoy participating in extracurricular activities
  like FOOTBALL,GAMING & CODING where I can collaborate with peers and develop practical skills. I'm
  driven by a desire to make a positive impact through technology and engineering, and I'm excited to
  see where this journey takes me!
